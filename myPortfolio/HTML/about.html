        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Katelyn Correa and I am recent recipient of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Lewis University. I have a passion for development, but that has not always been the case. When I first started my journey in higher education I tried various different concentrations. I started being in business and accounting. It was not until I had met the right mentors did I realize my passion in development.

            I knew I loved to be creative. I love making music and seeing my ideas come to life. I apply this when I am working on projects today. To some, programming may seem like an unimaginitve and routine like career, but I see it as an opportunity to be innovative and to create something new.

            It seems to me that the goal of technology has always been to solve problems and to make tasks easier for people whether they are a scientist or a commoner. I imagine myself developing applications to solve problems that consumers did not even know they had. I imagine myself developing sites that connect people together and create dialogue across different communities.
